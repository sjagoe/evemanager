The following may not build all libraries as a large portion of the
software is incomplete.  All that works is the EVE_API_Qt module, and
a small application intended to verify that fetching data from the
online API and the internal cache works as intended.  It may be
necessary to build these modules independently from the rest of the
application.  I intend to refactor the EVE API Qt module to allow for
automated testing using the framework built into Qt before continuing
with development.

Now the modules can be built
   1 qmake
   2 make release
